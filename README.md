### [ Rules ]:

    Your aim is to destroy the enemy nexus 🔻, while protecting your own. 💎
    To attack a nexus, a champion must first break through the enemies minions.
    Minions spawn in waves at the start of each combat sequence.
    A combat sequence consists of 5 actions. Each combat action cost 1 action point.
    Certain actions, such as going to base or purchasing items, cost more action points.
    A minion wave consists of 2 melee minions, and 3 caster minions.
    Every three waves, a stronger canon minion will be added to the wave.
    Minions award gold when killed, which can be used to purchase items.
    Attempting to buy an item will send you back to base, even if you don't have enough gold!
