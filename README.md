🌌 Space Adventure – Game Rules

You are a Space Captain 🚀 exploring the galaxy. From your ship, you can travel to different planets — Mars 🌕, Venus 🌋, and Jupiter 🌪 — each filled with unique dangers like oxygen depletion 🫁, violent storms 🌩, and hostile aliens 👾.

Once you land, you must decide whether to explore 🔍, gather resources ⛏, or flee back to your ship 🏃. After each mission, you can continue your journey and visit another planet, or end the game 🛑 whenever you choose.

The adventure continues in a loop until you decide your captain’s story is over.
